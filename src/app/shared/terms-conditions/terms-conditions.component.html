          <strong>Listing Account</strong>
          <p>
            The Class Master will establish a Listing account enabling Client to purchase listing
            services (“The Class Master listing”) that The Class Master makes available to Client in
            connection with The Class Master’s websites, mobile applications, and other properties,
            including properties set forth in a Purchase Order (“Services”). Each such purchase will
            be set forth in a purchase order agreed to in writing by both parties which sets forth
            the The Class Master listings being purchased, applicable fees, the duration of the paid
            listing commitment (the “Commitment Period”), renewal terms, and the date that paid
            listing will commence, among other information (“Purchase Order”). Each Purchase Order
            is governed by and incorporated into the Terms, and any conflict between them will be
            resolved in favor of the Purchase Order. Client’s initial Purchase Order is attached to
            these Terms

          <strong> The Class Master Listing </strong>
          <p>
            The Class Master Listing encompass a range of different advertising programs.
            <br />
            The “Starter Kit” allows Client to access advanced features in connection with its
            business profile page, such as posting multiple programs, photo & video, and dedicated
            account support. As it develops new advertising features, The Class Master may from time
            to time replace any of the foregoing features with features of substantially similar
            value.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong> Fees and Payment </strong>
          <p>
            Client will pay The Class Master the fees specified in each Purchase Order for the
            duration of its term. The fees are fixed for the duration of the commitment period
            specified in the applicable Purchase Order, but may be modified by The Class Master
            thereafter by providing one month’s prior written notice to Client. The fees are net of
            any taxes Client may be required to pay in its taxing jurisdiction. Payments are due in
            advance of the period for which they apply, or as otherwise set forth in the Purchase
            Order. Unpaid amounts or errors may be billed in subsequent invoices. If Client’s
            payment method fails or Client’s account is past due, The Class Master may collect past
            due amounts using other collection mechanisms, and Client agrees to pay all expenses
            associated with such collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
            <br />

            Website, The Class Master will not be responsible or assume any liability whatsoever in
            respect of any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly to you. All payments made
            on the Website, including payments made toward registration for classes, are
            non-refundable. In the event payment is deducted from the User’s account with
            non-completion of the booking, the exact amount shall be refunded to the User via the
            same mode of payment within 3-5 working days. All commercial terms are on a
            principal-to-principal basis between the Merchant and the users and The Class Master’s
            payment facility is merely used to facilitate the completion of the transaction.
            Transaction charges, not limited to payment gateway charges, shall be applicable, unless
            explicitly waived off by The Class Master.
            <br />
            IF CLIENT PROVIDES The Class Master WITH CREDIT CARD, DEBIT CARD, OR BANK ACCOUNT
            INFORMATION, CLIENT AUTHORIZES The Class Master TO USE SUCH PAYMENT INFORMATION TO
            AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE CLIENT ON A RECURRING BASIS TO COLLECT ALL FEES DUE HEREUNDER.
            CLIENT REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE IS AUTHORIZED TO INCUR CHARGES AGAINST THE PAYMENT CARD
            USED TO PURCHASE The Class Master ADS. THE FORM OF PAYMENT CANNOT BE CHANGED OR ALTERED

            Client represents and warrants to The Class Master that any information or materials
            that Client provides in connection with The Class Master listings will (a) be true and
            complete, (b) not contain any material which violates The Class Master’s content
            guidelines or which is otherwise unlawful, defamatory or obscene, or which infringes or

            coupon or other promotion appearing on or promoted through the Site by Client. The Class
            Master reserves the right to reject or remove any Advertising Materials at its sole
            discretion, and to alter any Advertising Materials to conform to technical
            specifications.
            <br />
            Client further represents and warrants to The Class Master that Client will not, and

            Master content and reviews from the Site, except as expressly permitted by The Class
            Master or (c) use any The Class Master trademarks in any manner without The Class
            Master’s prior written consent. All rights not expressly granted to Client hereunder are

          <strong> Information About and Use of the Site </strong>
          <p>
            The Site allows consumers to post reviews about businesses like Client’s. The Site
            employs automated software to help it showcase the most relevant and reliable reviews
            while suppressing others. Client’s purchase of The Class Master Ads will not influence
            the automated software, or otherwise allow or enable Client, directly or indirectly, to
            remove, alter or reorder the reviews on the Site.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong> Termination </strong>

          <p>
            Each Purchase Order will expire at the end of the Commitment Period unless (i) otherwise
            terminated earlier under these Terms or (ii) the Purchase Order contains a renewal
            period that automatically extends the term of the Purchase Order beyond the Commitment
            Period (collectively the “PO Term”). Client must provide written notice (an email to
            Client’s assigned The Class Master account representative is permissible) to terminate a
            Purchase Order on or before the 15th day of the month in order for the Purchase Order to
            terminate at the end of that month. If Client provides written notice after the 15th day
            of the month, then the Purchase Order will terminate at the end of the following month.
            Unless otherwise terminated as provided under the Terms, the Terms will automatically
            expire three (3) months after the termination or expiration of the last surviving
            Purchase Order.
            <br />
            IF CLIENT TERMINATES A PURCHASE ORDER BEFORE THE END OF THE COMMITMENT PERIOD, CLIENT
            AGREES TO PAY ANY AND ALL EARLY TERMINATION FEES SET FORTH IN THE PURCHASE ORDER(S),
            RECOGNIZING THAT The Class Master BEARS CERTAIN UP-FRONT COSTS, AND THAT THERE IS AN
            IMPLIED PRICING DISCOUNT BASED ON THE LENGTH OF CLIENT’S CHOSEN COMMITMENT PERIOD.
            <br />
            The Class Master may terminate any Purchase Order or the Terms at any time for any or no
            reason without liability, effective immediately, by providing written notice to Client.
            In the event of such termination, Client will immediately pay all unpaid The Class
            Master Ad fees through the date of termination, and The Class Master will reimburse any
            fees that were prepaid for The Class Master Ads to be rendered after the date of such
            termination.

          <strong> Miscellaneous </strong>
          <p>
            (a) The Terms and its exhibits are expressly limited to and made conditional upon
            Client’s acceptance of its terms and conditions before the Expiration Date. Any of
            Client’s terms or conditions which are in addition to or different from those contained
            in or added by way of interlineation to the Terms or any Purchase Order as originally
            provided to Client by The Class Master which are not separately expressly agreed to in
            writing by both parties are deemed material and are hereby objected to and rejected by
            The Class Master. No conditions, printed or otherwise, appearing on other contracts,
            orders or copy instructions which conflict with, vary, or add to these Terms will be
            binding on The Class Master, and any conflicting or additional terms contain in any
            other documents or oral discussions are void. The Terms embody the entire and exclusive
            agreement between the parties respecting the subject matter of herein, and supersede any
            and all prior related oral, emailed or written representations and agreements between
            the parties. No statements or promises by either party have been relied upon in entering
            into these Terms, except as expressly set forth herein.
            <br />
            (b) Anyone agreeing to the Terms on behalf of Client represents and warrants that it has
            full legal power and authority to enter into these Terms, perform its obligations
            hereunder, and authorize the fee payments set forth in the Purchase Order(s).
            <br />
            (c) Notices under these Terms must be in writing and sent via facsimile, registered or
            certified mail or commercial courier to the parties at their respective addresses set
            forth herein.
            <br />
            (d) The Terms may not be amended or modified except as agreed upon in writing by the
            parties. No provision in the Terms may be waived, except pursuant to a writing executed
            by the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. Client may not assign any
            rights or obligations under the Terms without The Class Master’s prior consent, and any
            purported assignment by Client shall be void. If any provision of the Terms is held to
            be invalid or unenforceable, the parties will substitute for the affected provision a
            valid or enforceable provision that approximates the intent and economic effect of the
            affected provision. Sections VII, VIII, IX, X and XI of the Terms will survive any
            termination of the Term.
